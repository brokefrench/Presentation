# Presentation
My portfolio website: an AWS Project

This web application will serve as a portfolio for my work. It will be using IAM, Amplify, Cognito, Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB, with all of the code side stored in this page and incorporated into a CI/CD pipeline with Amplify.

This site will let you create an account and log in, watch most of my work and possibly reach out to me through the Contact section.
